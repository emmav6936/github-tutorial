## Git vs. GitHub
Git is version control. As you work on your code you can commit changes, which is taking snapshots of your code, to see what you've done piece by piece. GitHub is an online server where you can use Git. It is a cloud where all your work is saved and you can use it from any device with internet access. You can also use GitHub to collaborate with other uses on projects. While GitHub requires Git, Git does not require GitHub.
